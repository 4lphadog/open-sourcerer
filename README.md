# Hi! 
This is a repository for the DIY Makers who are earning the Open Sourcer Skill.

We'll use the files in this repository to learn how to be open sourcerers - sharing and collaborating on ideas! 

Visit the [DIY Open Sourcerer Skill Page](http://www.diy.org/skills/OpenSourcerer).
(This isn't live yet, so actually you'll just have to wait. Meanwhile, check out the other [skills](http://www.diy.org/skills) on [DIY.org](http://www.diy.org))
